            <h5>About</h5>
Pico Tours was founded at the end of 2018 by a development team who took part in the Code Gorilla Bootcamp. Legend says the team never left eachothers side and fought off the bugs despite many attempts of the bugs to exploit the team. 

Pico tours is a platform for tour guides that specialize in smaller groups. Smaller groups reduce stress experienced by locals due to mass tourism, which makes them more sustainable. People taking part in the tours are welcomed in an old fashioned way and greeted with the same hospitality before mass tourism hit places like Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam.

Our tour guides are freelancers and use our platform to grow their businesses, which makes them responsible for every stage after the booking. Our guides aim is to bring you the best possible local experience. As a facilitator, Pico Tours accepts no responsibility after the booking process is finished but will take it's role seriously to check and verify it's guides when possible.
